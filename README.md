# IceRidges Simulation

This simulation is based on the work by Ilija Samardzija https://github.com/ilijasam/IceRidges

To set up the python environment using conda run `initialize_python.py`. It will guide you through all necessary steps. Alternatively, set up your environment manually by using Anaconda Navigator as GUI or via the terminal. Then you have to install all necessary packages manually. A list of all packages can be found in `initialize_python.py`.
